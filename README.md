Claim Guard is an AI-powered healthcare application designed to help patients verify hospital billing details and check whether they are eligible for insurance benefits before submitting a claim. The app allows users to upload hospital bills, which are analyzed using OCR and AI to extract procedures, medicines, and charges, and then compare them with the user’s insurance policy coverage, exclusions, waiting periods, and sub-limits. Claim Guard identifies whether expenses are fully covered, partially covered, or not covered, while also flagging potential overbilling, duplicate charges, and non-eligible items. To further assist users, the app predicts the likelihood of claim approval and clearly explains possible reasons for rejection in simple, easy-to-understand language. By reducing claim rejections, preventing unnecessary financial loss, and improving transparency in hospital billing, Claim Guard aims to reduce stress for patients and make the insurance claim process more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly.
