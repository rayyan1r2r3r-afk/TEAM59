Our Project is CLAIMGARUD and it helps in understanding the health insurance claims and better understanding them .
CLAIMGAURD distinguishes between the insurance claims that are covered by the insurance provided and the claims that are not . 
It provides further information about the billing statements in the hospital and helps in reducing the addition or extra costs that are billed by the hospital and summarizes it in a easy to understand way,
CLAIM GAURD also scans an image of an bill and gives an clear and defined explanation of the billings ,weather they are properly given and what are covered in insurance claims
